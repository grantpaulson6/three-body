# three-body

## Hack Day 2021
For Hack Day, we wanted a fun project that was both interesting and would allow us to explore new technologies. The inspiration for the idea came from the [Three Body Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem) presented in the famous sci-fi novel of the same name by Liu Cixin. Using Three.js, a JavaScript 3D library, we created a visualizer for what the three body problem looks like. The naming of the framework couldn't be more perfect for our purposes.

```bash
